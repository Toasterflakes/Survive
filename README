note: Looking back on this project, I understand that I may not have used the
      best coding practices and structure choices -- however, this was definitely
      a great learning experience and I absolutely gained value from doing this
      little project. It was pretty fun too :)

=====================================================================================


This program is a day(turn) based survival game. Scavange for resources and 
manage your items efficiently in order to survive long enough for someone to 
rescue your party. You begin day one with 4 items in your backpack that can be used 
to heal each of the people in your party. Each day, your hp decreases slightly
(a rand() algorithm seeded with the "time.h" library is used to /randomize/ within
a set field of values). 
You also have the oportunity to send someone out to look for items.
If you survive for 30 days, you will be saved. Otherwise, you die. 
Good luck.
